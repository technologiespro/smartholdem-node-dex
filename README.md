# Full Node SmartHoldem Platform Level-A

The Smartholdem consensus is an innovative two-level delegative algorithm of evidence of the 2ndLevel-DPoS share. 
The delegated confirmation of the share is a unique model of the decentralized form of the technical democracy.

The delegative two-level share proof, 2ndLevel-DPOS, is an innovative way to protect the SmartHoldem net.
